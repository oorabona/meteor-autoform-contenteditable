# Meteor AutoForm contenteditable input type

This package should address the issue of showing content on load.

See these two bug reports: [#997](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform/issues/997) and [#844](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform/issues/844)

# Notes

It overrides the ```contenteditable``` input type of ```AutoForm```. Probably would be better to merge.
